	"Small"
	Since on the first line variable "i" is declared as 10, "i" is not bigger than 10, hence "Small" is printed

Refer to 5_2.go

3. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
