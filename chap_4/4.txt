1.
you can create a variable from the following ways:
	var <variable name> <variable type> = <data>
	OR
	<variable name> := <data>

2.
6 (x += 1 represents x = x + 1 and since x := 5, x = 6 when program is run)

3.
Scope refers to where a particular asset (or in this case, a variable) is available to be accessed by a function. You can determine the scope of the variable by looking if the variable is being declared within or outside a function. A variable declared within a function can only be accessed by that particular function whereas a variable declared outside the functions can be used by any.

4.
Constants cannot be changed later and are fixed, variables can change.

5.
Refer to 4_5.go (this program is pretty clear cut, all you really need to do is edit the original program and change the output function)

6.
Refer to 4_6.go (likewise this program is exactly like the original one, only difference is the operations.)
