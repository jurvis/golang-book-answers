#Golang-book Answers

##Explanation
This is my attempt in solving all of the Problems underneath the chapters of Caleb Doxey's [book](http://www.golang-book.com/).

##How To Use
There is a certain structure to how these files are names. Of course, the first thing you want to do is to make sure you have set up your environment. You can find a guide [here](http://golang.org/doc/code.html).

###Explanations
Most of the Explanations for code will be commented within the code itself, if not, it will be under the .txt file within the chapter folder. 3.txt for Chapter 3, 4.txt for Chapter 4, so and so forth...

###Actual Code
For example if I'm looking for answers to the problem on the 4th bulletpoint of chapter 7, the code with the answers will be 7_4.go, if I'm looking for the answers to the problem for the 2nd bulletpoint of chapter 7, it will be 7_2.go.

There are also alternative answers to certain problems, either made just so it has better functionality, they don't necessarily answer directly to those problems! So do take note of that :)

##Feedback
Of course, the answers here aren't perfect and there are bound to be updates as I go through the book, but if there are any improvements I can make, [feel free](http://github.com/jurvis/golang-book-answers/issues/).

##Special Thanks
Caleb Doxsey for his awesome and easy to understand [book](http://www.golang-book.com/)
